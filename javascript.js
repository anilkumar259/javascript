What is JavaScript?
A: A scripting language used to create and control dynamic content on websites.
	
How do you declare a variable in JavaScript?
A: Using var, let, or const.
	
Here are simple examples for var, let, and const ‚Äî all in one place:
	üîπ var ‚Äì function-scoped, can be redeclared & reassigned
			var x = 10;
			var x = 20; // ‚úÖ redeclared
			x = 30;     // ‚úÖ reassigned
			console.log(x); // 30
	üîπ let ‚Äì block-scoped, cannot be redeclared, but can be reassigned
			let y = 10;
			// let y = 20; ‚ùå SyntaxError: Identifier 'y' has already been declared
			y = 25;      // ‚úÖ reassigned
			console.log(y); // 25
  üîπ const ‚Äì block-scoped, cannot be redeclared or reassigned
			const z = 10;
			// z = 15;    ‚ùå TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
			console.log(z); // 10

What‚Äôs the difference between let and const?
A: let allows reassignment; const does not.

What are the data types in JavaScript?
A: String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Object, Symbol, BigInt.

	Type	  Description	Example
	String	Text data	"Hello", '123'
	Number	Numeric values (integers, floats)	42, 3.14, -7
	Boolean	True or false values	true, false
	Undefined	Variable declared but not assigned	let x; // x is undefined
	Null	Intentionally empty or no value	let y = null;
	Symbol	Unique, immutable identifiers	Symbol('id')
	BigInt	For very large integers	12345678901234567890n
	Object	Collections of key-value pairs	{ name: 'Alice', age: 25 }

Primitive types: String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, BigInt
Non-primitive type: Object (includes arrays, functions, etc

What does typeof operator do?
A: Returns the type of a variable as a string (e.g., "number", "object").

What is the difference between == and ===?
A: == checks value with type coercion; === checks value and type.

What is NaN?
A: It stands for "Not-a-Number". Example: parseInt('abc') returns NaN.

What is hoisting?
A: JavaScript moves variable and function declarations to the top of the scope during compile time.

What is the difference between null and undefined?
A: undefined means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value; null is intentionally set as "no value".

 What is a callback function in JavaScript?
A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed later, either synchronously or asynchronously, depending on how and when it's called.

What is a closure?
A closure is a function that can access variables from its outer function even after the outer function has finished running.
